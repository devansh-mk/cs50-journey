# CS50 Journey

### Day 1
- Completed ~40 minutes of CS50 Week 0 lecture.
- Understood basics of binary, bytes, and scratch concepts.
- Created GitHub account and first repository.
- Planned daily structured routine.
- More updates coming!

### Day 2
- Watched ~30 minutes of CS50 Lecture 0 (covered colors, RGB, algorithms).
- Started using Notion for structured notes.
- Wrote notes for first hour of Lecture 0.
- Adjusted study timing for better focus.
- Stayed consistent despite mental fatigue.

### Day 3
- Completed detailed notes for Lecture 0 (Part 1) with diagrams and key concepts.
- Revisited portions of lecture to reinforce understanding.
- Improved note structure for clarity and long-term reference.
- Maintained consistency despite limited available time.
- Preparing for stronger focus tomorrow.

### Day 4
- Explored deeper, system-level questions about how computers interpret data (binary signals, place values, transistor states, voltage logic).
- Built strong internal understanding of character encoding systems (ASCII vs Unicode) and why binary is fundamentally used in hardware.
- Strengthened foundational intuition by actively questioning how low-level representations translate into higher-level computing concepts.
### Day 5
- Explored the RGB color model in depth and clarified how individual channels contribute to final pixel output.
- Enhanced and reorganized Week 0 notes in notion to improve conceptual structure and long-term usability.
- Demostrated consistensy by completing a focused study session and sustaining learning momentum.

## Day 6 — Day 20 (3 Weeks Progress Summary)
*(Grouped because progress was focused on a single major project: PS0)*

### PS0: Jungle Boy (Scratch Game Project) – Completed
- Designed and built a full pixel-art style game with movement, collectibles, hazards, and a victory screen.
- Implemented structured event logic: title screen → instructions → gameplay → win state.
- Fixed multiple bugs by reasoning about how Scratch executes scripts in parallel.
- Learned why forever caused race conditions and how repeat until created a stable fall–respawn cycle.
- Added random spawn logic, boundary checks, sprite interactions, and backdrop-based triggers.
- Polished UI (sounds, title screen, instructions, sprite transitions).

### Concepts Strengthened
- Sequential vs parallel execution in Scratch  
- Custom blocks for encapsulation and clean logic  
- Event-driven programming flow  
- Collision checks, game loops, and state transitions  
- Debugging timing issues and script conflicts  
- Core CS ideas from Lecture 0:
  - Binary, ASCII vs Unicode  
  - RGB color model  
  - How lower-level representation leads to higher-level behavior  

### Reflection
- Stayed consistent in problem solving even when daily hours fluctuated.
- Focused on deep understanding, not rushing.
- Gained strong intuition for logical flow, debugging, and how computers interpret instructions.
- Fully ready to begin CS50 Week 1 (C programming) with confidence.

Day 21:
- Completed CS50 Problem Set 0 (Scratch) and submitted successfully.
- Started CS50 Week 1 (C) lecture and completed 2/3 of the whole lecture with clarity.
- Covered topics including: C basics, compilation, functions, variables, input/output, strings, and formatted printing, etc.
- Focused on understanding mental models rather than writing code during the lecture.
