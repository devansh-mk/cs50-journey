# CS50 Journey

### Day 1
- Completed ~40 minutes of CS50 Week 0 lecture.
- Understood basics of binary, bytes, and scratch concepts.
- Created GitHub account and first repository.
- Planned daily structured routine.
- More updates coming!

### Day 2
- Watched ~30 minutes of CS50 Lecture 0 (covered colors, RGB, algorithms).
- Started using Notion for structured notes.
- Wrote notes for first hour of Lecture 0.
- Adjusted study timing for better focus.
- Stayed consistent despite mental fatigue.

### Day 3
- Completed detailed notes for Lecture 0 (Part 1) with diagrams and key concepts.
- Revisited portions of lecture to reinforce understanding.
- Improved note structure for clarity and long-term reference.
- Maintained consistency despite limited available time.
- Preparing for stronger focus tomorrow.

### Day 4
- Explored deeper, system-level questions about how computers interpret data (binary signals, place values, transistor states, voltage logic).
- Built strong internal understanding of character encoding systems (ASCII vs Unicode) and why binary is fundamentally used in hardware.
- Strengthened foundational intuition by actively questioning how low-level representations translate into higher-level computing concepts.
